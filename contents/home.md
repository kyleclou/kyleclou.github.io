I am a junior studying Computer Engineering at the University of California, San Diego. My research focuses on digital signal processing, statistical signal analysis, and control systems, with applications ranging from adaptive filtering to analyzing complex experimental datasets. I look to apply these techniques beyond traditional domains, exploring their use in computer vision, machine learning, and other interdisciplinary fields.

I am proud to be part of [RareLabs](https://rarelabs.ucsd.edu/) at UC San Diego, working with [Professor Aobo Li](https://aobol.github.io/AoboLi/) on developing algorithms for filtering dark matter signals from experimental datasets. My work involves leveraging techniques in digital signal processing, statistical signal analysis, and adaptive filtering to identify and extract meaningful patterns from noise-heavy data.

Previously, I worked as an intern at Daiwa Capital Markets in Hong Kong, where I designed and implemented a data analysis platform for the Hong Kong exchange. This project involved processing large-scale financial datasets and building tools to support data-driven insights for trading and investment decisions. The experience strengthened my skills in data analysis, algorithm development, and applying engineering principles to high-impact, real-world challenges.
